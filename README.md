# liri-node-app
A node application to retrieve API information

This application is a similar to Siri in that it will return information for the user.

However, this version is a bit less complex as it uses aspects of NodeJS for the user to input the request with the keyboard.

I used the following NodeJS packages to achieve this:

"axios
"dotenv"
"moment"
"node-spotify-api"

I had significant challenges with this activity, specifically getting the spotify callback to work and return the correct information that was requested.
